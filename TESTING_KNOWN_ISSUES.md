# Known Testing Issues

This document tracks known issues with the test harness that do **not** indicate bugs in the application code.

## Purpose

This document helps both **human developers** and **AI agents** (Claude, Codex) distinguish between:
- ‚ùå Real bugs that need fixing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Known test harness limitations that don't indicate broken functionality

**Why this matters for AI agents:**
AI agents have no memory between sessions and can't ask teammates about recurring issues. Without this documentation, an AI agent will waste time investigating and potentially "fixing" working code.

---

## Workflow for Adding New Issues

**When an AI agent discovers a potential "known issue":**
1. ü§ñ AI explains the issue and proposes documenting it
2. üë§ Human decides: "Document it" / "No, fix it" / "Document until Phase X"
3. ü§ñ AI adds/updates documentation with human approval
4. üìù Add "Documented by: [Human/AI name] on YYYY-MM-DD"

**When a human discovers a known issue:**
1. Add it to "Active Issues" below using the template
2. Add code comments pointing to this doc
3. Note discovery date and who found it

---

## Workflow for Resolving Issues

**When an AI agent fixes a known issue:**
1. ü§ñ AI fixes the issue and verifies tests pass
2. ü§ñ AI proposes documentation updates (see checklist below)
3. üë§ Human reviews: "Approved" / "Modify the documentation" / "Not actually fixed"
4. ü§ñ AI updates documentation with human approval

**When a human fixes a known issue:**
1. Fix the issue and verify tests pass
2. Follow the maintenance checklist below
3. Or ask an AI agent to update the documentation for you

**MAINTENANCE CHECKLIST** - What needs updating:
1. ‚úÖ Move the issue from "Active Issues" to "Resolved Issues" section
2. ‚úÖ Add resolution date, who fixed it, and fix description
3. ‚úÖ Remove or update code comments that reference this issue
4. ‚úÖ Search codebase for `TESTING_KNOWN_ISSUES.md` references and update them
5. ‚úÖ Update affected test files to remove workarounds
6. ‚úÖ Verify all tests now pass without workarounds

## Active Issues

### Frontend: React Testing Library Async Timing

**Documented by:** Claude on 2025-10-11
**Affects:** Phase 1B (Agent Advisory), Phase 1C (Listing Integrations)

**Symptom:**
Frontend tests fail with "Unable to find an element with the text..." even though the HTML dump clearly shows the content is rendered correctly in the DOM.

**Example:**
```
Unable to find an element with the text: /Linked accounts/i

Ignored nodes: comments, script, style
<body>
  <div class="integrations__panel">
    <h2>Linked accounts</h2>  <!-- ‚Üê Content is clearly present -->
    <p class="integrations__empty">No accounts linked yet.</p>
  </div>
</body>
```

**Root Cause:**
React state updates complete after `waitFor()` timeout in the JSDOM test environment. This is a test harness timing issue with how React Testing Library queries interact with JSDOM's async rendering cycle.

**Impact:**
- **Application functionality:** ‚úÖ Works correctly
- **Manual testing:** ‚úÖ Page renders and behaves correctly
- **Backend API tests:** ‚úÖ Pass successfully
- **Frontend unit tests:** ‚ùå Timeout finding rendered elements

**What NOT to do:**
- Do not modify application code to "fix" these test failures
- Do not remove or skip these tests entirely
- Do not assume the feature is broken

**What TO do:**
1. **Verify functionality manually** by running the app and testing the page
2. **Check backend tests pass** - if they do, the API layer is working
3. **Look at the HTML dump** in test output - if content is present, rendering works
4. **Document test status** in phase completion notes

**Tests affected:**
- `frontend/src/pages/__tests__/AgentAdvisoryPage.test.tsx` (Phase 1B)
- `frontend/src/pages/__tests__/AgentIntegrationsPage.test.tsx` (Phase 1C)

**Workarounds attempted:**
- ‚úÖ Increased `waitFor` timeout to 3000ms - still fails
- ‚úÖ Switched from `waitFor + getByText` to `findByText` - still fails
- ‚úÖ Added manual `setTimeout` delays - still fails
- ‚ùå Root fix pending: likely needs React Testing Library configuration or different query strategy

**Related issues:**
- Same pattern occurred in Phase 1B and Phase 1C
- Other page tests (e.g., AgentsGpsCapturePage) work because they don't have async `useEffect` data fetching on mount

**Future fix considerations:**
1. Configure React Testing Library with longer default timeouts for this project
2. Use `act()` wrapper more explicitly for async state updates
3. Mock the `useEffect` data fetching in tests
4. Switch to Playwright/Cypress for integration tests that don't have this JSDOM limitation

### SQLite vs PostgreSQL SQL Compatibility

**Documented by:** Claude on 2025-10-11
**Affects:** Backend tests using raw SQL

**Symptom:**
Raw SQL queries using PostgreSQL-specific syntax fail in tests.

**Example:**
```sql
-- ‚ùå Fails in SQLite tests
UPDATE listing_integration_accounts
SET expires_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes'

-- ‚úÖ Works in SQLite
UPDATE listing_integration_accounts
SET expires_at = datetime('now', '-10 minutes')
```

**Solution:**
Always wrap raw SQL in `text()` and use SQLite-compatible syntax for tests:
```python
from sqlalchemy import text

await session.execute(
    text("UPDATE table SET expires_at = datetime('now', '-10 minutes')")
)
```

**Note:** Production uses PostgreSQL, but tests use in-memory SQLite for speed.

## Resolved Issues

### Backend: API Tests Skipped on Python 3.9 - RESOLVED

**Resolution Date:** 2025-10-11
**Resolved By:** Claude (with user)
**Fix Description:** Upgraded to Python 3.13 and added proper dependency mocking for FastAPI tests

**How it was fixed:**
1. Upgraded Python from 3.9.6 to 3.13.8 using Homebrew
2. Created fresh virtual environment with Python 3.13
3. Added dependency overrides in test fixture for `require_reviewer`, `require_viewer`, and `get_optional_user`
4. Installed minimal dependencies: `python-jose[cryptography]`, `passlib[bcrypt]`, `httpx`, `pytest-asyncio`

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/tests/test_api/test_deals.py` - Added dependency mocking for auth and role checks
- `.venv/` - Recreated with Python 3.13.8

**Test Results:**
```bash
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_services/test_agent_deal_pipeline.py backend/tests/test_api/test_deals.py -v
# Result: 3 passed, 0 skipped ‚úÖ
```

**Original Issue:** API tests were skipped on Python 3.9 due to FastAPI dependency injection limitations

### Example of AI Agent Resolution Workflow

Here's how it would work when an AI agent fixes an issue:

```
ü§ñ AI: "I've fixed the React Testing Library async timing issue. All tests now pass
       consistently. Here's what I changed:

       - Configured React Testing Library with 5000ms default timeout
       - Added proper `act()` wrappers around async state updates
       - Updated test setup in test-bootstrap.mjs

       Tests now pass:
       ‚úÖ frontend/src/pages/__tests__/AgentAdvisoryPage.test.tsx
       ‚úÖ frontend/src/pages/__tests__/AgentIntegrationsPage.test.tsx

       Should I update TESTING_KNOWN_ISSUES.md to move this to 'Resolved Issues'
       and remove the warning comments from the test files?"

üë§ You: "Yes, approved"

ü§ñ AI: *Updates documentation following the maintenance checklist*
```
