# Playwright browser cache

This directory should contain the contents of `~/.cache/ms-playwright` generated by running

```
pnpm -C frontend exec playwright install --with-deps
```

on a machine with internet access. After installing the browsers, copy the files from the
source machine into this folder (or generate the `.playwright-browsers.tar.gz` archive described
in `docs/frontend.md` and extract it here) so that offline environments can run `pnpm -C frontend test:e2e`
without attempting to download new binaries.

The repository's Playwright test script checks for `browsers.json` inside this directory and exits
with a helpful message if the cache is missing.
