# Playwright browser cache

This directory should contain the contents of `~/.cache/ms-playwright` generated by running

```
pnpm --dir frontend exec playwright install
```

on a machine with internet access. After installing the browsers, copy the files from the
source machine into this folder (or generate the `.playwright-browsers.tar.gz` archive described
in `docs/frontend.md` and extract it here) so that offline environments can run
`pnpm --dir frontend test:e2e` without attempting to download new binaries. If the host machine
does not have apt access, export `PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALL_WITH_DEPS=0` before invoking the install
command above.

The repository's Playwright test script checks for `browsers.json` inside this directory and exits
with a helpful message if the cache is missing.
