# Data Operations Handbook

This directory captures the operating procedures for the reference data that
feeds the Optimal Build platform.  Each document is maintained alongside the
codebase so that policy, engineering, and review practices remain in lockstep.

* [`data_sources_policy.md`](data_sources_policy.md) — sourcing standards,
  catalogues, and benchmark indices with licensing guidance.
* [`update_cadence.md`](update_cadence.md) — ingestion frequency and
  monitoring expectations for each upstream feed.
* [`reviewer_sop.md`](reviewer_sop.md) — the checklist followed by data
  reviewers prior to promoting new references to production.
* [`export_api.md`](export_api.md) — CAD/BIM export endpoint reference for
  frontend integrations.
* [`finance_api.md`](finance_api.md) — finance feasibility endpoints and CSV
  export contract for reporting teams.
* [`feasibility_workflows.md`](feasibility_workflows.md) — feasibility wizard
  endpoints, payloads, and regression coverage.
* [`sample_fixtures.md`](sample_fixtures.md) — provenance and guidance for the
  repository's CAD/BIM fixtures used in automated tests.
