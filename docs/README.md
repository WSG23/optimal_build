## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Start building without reading FEATURES.md
- Jump to Phase 2+ before Phase 1 is validated
- Build features not listed in FEATURES.md
- Ignore the delivery plan dependencies
- Skip validation gates

### ✅ DO:
- Always check NEXT_STEPS_FOR_AI_AGENTS_AND_DEVELOPERS.md before starting
- Follow the phase order in feature_delivery_plan_v2.md
- Get validation feedback between phases
- Update progress in feature_delivery_plan_v2.md and WORK_QUEUE.MD as you go
- Ask questions if requirements are unclear

## 🤝 Getting Help

**For strategic questions:** Review `planning/features.md` and `feature_delivery_plan_v2.md`
**For technical questions:** Check CODING_RULES.md and existing code
**For priority questions:** Check WORK_QUEUE.MD and NEXT_STEPS_FOR_AI_AGENTS_AND_DEVELOPERS.md
**For user questions:** Check feature-specific guides

**Still unclear?** Ask the project owner before proceeding.

## 🔄 Keeping Documentation Current

**After completing a feature:**
1. Update `WORK_QUEUE.MD` (move item, add commits, document follow-ups)
2. Update status in `feature_delivery_plan_v2.md` (❌ → ✅)
3. Update `NEXT_STEPS_FOR_AI_AGENTS_AND_DEVELOPERS.md` with new priorities
4. Add user guide if customer-facing feature
5. Update this README if major milestone reached

**After validation session:**
1. Document feedback in `validation/` directory
2. Update delivery plan with any scope changes
3. Revise estimates if needed

**Remember:** FEATURES.md is the source of truth. Everything else supports delivering it.
