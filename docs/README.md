## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Start building without reading FEATURES.md
- Jump to Phase 2+ before Phase 1 is validated
- Build features not listed in FEATURES.md
- Ignore the delivery plan dependencies
- Skip validation gates

### ✅ DO:
- Always check NEXT_STEPS_FOR_AI_AGENTS_AND_DEVELOPERS.md before starting
- Follow the phase order in feature_delivery_plan_v2.md
- Get validation feedback between phases
- Update progress in the delivery plan as you go
- Ask questions if requirements are unclear

## 🔄 Keeping Documentation Current

**After completing a feature:**
1. Update status in `feature_delivery_plan_v2.md` (❌ → ✅)
2. Update `NEXT_STEPS_FOR_AI_AGENTS_AND_DEVELOPERS.md` with new priorities
3. Add user guide if customer-facing feature
4. Update this README if major milestone reached

**After validation session:**
1. Document feedback in `validation/` directory
2. Update delivery plan with any scope changes
3. Revise estimates if needed
