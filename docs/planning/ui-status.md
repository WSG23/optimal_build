# UI Status

> **Note:** This document clarifies the status of frontend UI components.

## Current UI Status

**ALL frontend UI in Phase 1 and Phase 2 serves as production-quality B2B software.**

The UI was built following professional standards for commercial real estate professionals.

## Key Points

1. **Production Quality Required:** All UI must be professional, polished, and user-friendly
2. **Manual QA Required:** See phase-specific QA checklists in `docs/development/testing/`
3. **Design Tokens:** Use design tokens from `frontend/UI_STANDARDS.md`

## UI Implementation Guidelines

- Follow the Square Cyber-Minimalism design language
- Use design tokens for all spacing, colors, and border-radius values
- Never hardcode pixel values or colors
- Reference `frontend/UX_ARCHITECTURE.md` for layout patterns
