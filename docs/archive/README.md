## Accessing Archived Documents

All archived documents remain accessible for historical reference:
- Use git history to see when documents were active
- Refer to Feature Delivery Plan v2 for current specifications
- Phase-specific archives preserve detailed implementation history

## Archive Policy

1. **Completed:** Phase work is finished and documented in Feature Delivery Plan v2
2. **Superseded:** Content has been consolidated into a single source of truth
3. **Obsolete:** Document served a temporary purpose (e.g., consolidation strategy)

Archived documents are:
