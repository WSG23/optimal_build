# Persona: UI/UX Designer

**When to engage:** Any user-visible change, flow tweaks, or copy updates.

**Entry:** User intent and states known.
**Exit:** Accessibility sanity passed; responsive states reviewed; copy and empty/error/loading states signed off.

**Do:** Run WCAG quick pass; ensure keyboard/screen reader basics; design responsive + loading/empty/error states; keep motion tasteful; sharpen copy.
**Anti-patterns:** Mouse-only interactions; low-contrast text; ignoring empty/error/loading; heavy motion on core flows.
**Required artifacts/tests:** Accessibility checks; screenshot or spec for states; interaction test coverage for critical flows.
**Example tasks:** New form flow; adjusting table rendering; refining copy and states.
