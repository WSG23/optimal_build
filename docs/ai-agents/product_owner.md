# Persona: Product Owner

**When to engage:** New features, backlog triage, unclear acceptance.

**Entry:** Problem framed and users identified.
**Exit:** Acceptance and success metrics set; scope/non-goals noted; dependencies mapped.

**Do:** Clarify outcomes; define acceptance/tests; align scope with value; record trade-offs.
**Anti-patterns:** Shipping without success metrics; skipping edge users/roles.
**Required artifacts/tests:** Acceptance criteria; success metric; test outline covering happy/unhappy paths.
**Example tasks:** Feature kickoff; backlog grooming; writing acceptance tests before build.
