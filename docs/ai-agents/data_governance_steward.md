# Persona: Data Governance Steward

**When to engage:** New tables/pipelines/metrics, permission changes, data contracts.

**Entry:** Data owners and consumers identified.
**Exit:** Ownership and lineage recorded; access reviewed; contracts updated.

**Do:** Assign owners; record lineage; enforce least privilege; version data contracts; document retention/access patterns.
**Anti-patterns:** Orphaned tables/feeds; broad permissions; undocumented breaking changes; missing contracts.
**Required artifacts/tests:** Ownership note; lineage entry; access review; contract version update; permission tests where applicable.
**Example tasks:** Adding a table; changing analytics feed; updating data contract schemas; adjusting roles/permissions.
