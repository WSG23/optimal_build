## üìã Current Status

**You just completed:** Phase 1C Listing Integrations (Mock Flow with Token Lifecycle) ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed Phases:

| Phase | Feature | Status | Test Status |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **1A** | Agent GPS Capture | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Backend passing |
| **1A** | Marketing Pack Generation | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Backend passing |
| **1B** | Agent Advisory (Asset Mix, Positioning, Absorption, Feedback) | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Backend passing, ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend timing issue (documented) |
| **1C** | Listing Integrations Mock (PropertyGuru + Token Lifecycle) | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Backend passing, ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend timing issue (documented) |

### üìä Overall Progress:
- ‚úÖ **~75%** of Phase 1 (Agent Foundation) complete
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Waiting for human-led agent validation sessions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend tests have known JSDOM timing issues ‚Üí See [TESTING_KNOWN_ISSUES.md](../TESTING_KNOWN_ISSUES.md)

### üîç What We Just Verified (2025-10-11):
- ‚úÖ Backend test passes: `test_propertyguru_mock_flow` exercises full token lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Token helpers work: `is_token_valid()` and `needs_refresh()` in accounts.py
- ‚úÖ 401 on expired tokens works correctly
- ‚úÖ Database migration applied: `listing_integration_accounts` and `listing_publications` tables exist
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend test fails due to documented JSDOM async timing issue (feature works)

## üéØ What You Should Work On Next

### CHOOSE ONE OF THESE OPTIONS:

#### ‚≠ê **Option A: Harden Phase 1C - Token Encryption** (RECOMMENDED)

**Why this first:**
- Security requirement before accepting real OAuth credentials
- Prevents storing plaintext tokens in production
- Relatively small, focused task

**What to build:**
1. Add encryption/decryption for `access_token` and `refresh_token` fields
   - Use `cryptography.fernet.Fernet` or AWS KMS
   - Store encryption key in environment variable
   - Encrypt before save, decrypt on load
2. Update `ListingIntegrationAccountService` to handle encryption
3. Add tests for encrypted token storage/retrieval

**Files to modify:**
- `backend/app/services/integrations/accounts.py` - Add encryption helpers
- `backend/app/models/listing_integration.py` - Add property methods for token access
- `backend/tests/test_services/test_listing_integration_accounts.py` - Test encryption

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Tokens stored encrypted in database
- Service can decrypt and use tokens
- Tests verify encryption/decryption works
- Environment variable for encryption key

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 days

**References:**
- [Cryptography docs](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/)
- Similar pattern in existing codebase: `backend/app/core/security.py`

---

#### **Option B: Extend Mock Pattern to EdgeProp + Zoho**

**Why this:**
- Completes the mock integration foundation
- Validates the abstraction pattern works for multiple providers
- Enables testing multi-platform publishing

**What to build:**
1. Create `EdgePropClient` similar to `PropertyGuruClient`
2. Create `ZohoCRMClient` for lead management
3. Add endpoints for EdgeProp and Zoho in `listings.py`
4. Update frontend to show all three providers

**Files to create/modify:**
- `backend/app/services/integrations/edgeprop.py` - New client
- `backend/app/services/integrations/zoho.py` - New client
- `backend/app/api/v1/listings.py` - Add new endpoints
- `frontend/src/pages/AgentIntegrationsPage.tsx` - Show all providers
- `backend/tests/test_api/test_listing_integrations.py` - Test new flows

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Can connect/disconnect EdgeProp and Zoho accounts
- Can publish listings to all three platforms
- Token lifecycle works for all providers
- Tests exercise all three mocks

**Estimated effort:** 3-4 days

---

#### **Option C: Real PropertyGuru OAuth Implementation**

**Why this:**
- Enables real production integration
- Tests with actual API
- Validates token refresh flow

**BLOCKERS:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires PropertyGuru API credentials from user
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Option A (encryption) to be done first
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May need production OAuth callback URL

**What to build:**
1. Implement real OAuth flow (authorization_code grant)
2. Implement token refresh using refresh_token
3. Implement real listing publish API call
4. Handle API errors and rate limiting

**Files to modify:**
- `backend/app/services/integrations/propertyguru.py` - Replace mocks with real HTTP
- `backend/app/api/v1/listings.py` - Update OAuth callback handling
- `frontend/src/pages/AgentIntegrationsPage.tsx` - Real OAuth redirect flow

**Acceptance criteria:**
- OAuth flow redirects to PropertyGuru and back
- Stores real access/refresh tokens (encrypted)
- Can publish real listing to PropertyGuru
- Token refresh works automatically

**Estimated effort:** 5-7 days

**Prerequisites:**
1. Complete Option A (encryption) first
2. Obtain PropertyGuru API credentials from user
3. Configure OAuth callback URL

---

#### **Option D: Move to Phase 1D - Business Performance**

**What this is:**
- Agent deal tracking
- Commission calculations
- Performance analytics
- Portfolio management

**Why NOT recommended yet:**
- Phase 1B/1C validation hasn't happened yet
- Better to harden existing work first
- User may have feedback on advisory/integrations

**When to do this:**
- After user validates Phase 1A-1C
- After at least Option A (encryption) is done

---

## üö´ What NOT to Do Next

**DO NOT start these yet:**
- ‚ùå Phase 2 (Developer Tools) - must finish Phase 1 and validate first
- ‚ùå Phase 3 (Architects) - way too early
- ‚ùå Phase 4 (Engineers) - way too early
- ‚ùå Phase 5 (Gov APIs) - can start later in parallel
- ‚ùå Phase 6 (Polish) - much later

**Why?**
- The delivery plan follows logical dependencies
- Each phase must be validated before moving on
- Jumping ahead creates integration debt

- ‚úÖ You encounter blockers that prevent progress
- ‚úÖ You want to clarify feature requirements from FEATURES.md
- ‚úÖ You discover new test issues that need documenting

**DON'T ask about:**
- ‚ùå General implementation decisions (you can make those)
- ‚ùå Code structure (follow CODING_RULES.md)
- ‚ùå Testing approach (follow existing patterns)
- ‚ùå Documentation format (follow existing docs)
- ‚ùå Known test timing issues (documented in TESTING_KNOWN_ISSUES.md)
