## üéØ What You Should Work On Next

### IMMEDIATE (Next Task):
**Phase 1B: Development Advisory Services**

This can start NOW while waiting for Phase 1A validation.

**What to build:**
1. **Asset Mix Strategy Tool** (FEATURES.md lines 51)
   - Input: Property details + market data
   - Output: Optimal use mix recommendations for mixed-use developments
   - Backend: Optimization algorithm considering market demand
   - Frontend: Visual mix recommendations with rationale

2. **Market Positioning Calculator** (FEATURES.md lines 52)
   - Input: Property type, location, market segment
   - Output: Pricing strategy, tenant mix optimization
   - Backend: Pricing algorithm based on market intelligence
   - Frontend: Strategy dashboard with recommendations

3. **Absorption Forecasting Engine** (FEATURES.md lines 53)
   - Input: Property type, size, price point, market conditions
   - Output: Sales/leasing velocity predictions
   - Backend: Time-series forecasting model
   - Frontend: Velocity charts with confidence intervals

4. **Buyer/Tenant Feedback Loop** (FEATURES.md lines 54)
   - Input: Agent observations, market resistance
   - Output: Insights feed to developers
   - Backend: Feedback aggregation and analysis
   - Frontend: Feedback submission form + insights dashboard

**Files to create/modify:**
- `backend/app/services/agents/advisory.py` - New service
- `backend/app/api/v1/agents/advisory.py` - New API endpoints
- `frontend/src/pages/AgentAdvisoryPage.tsx` - New page
- `frontend/src/api/advisory.ts` - API client
- `backend/tests/test_services/test_advisory.py` - Tests

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Agent inputs property data and gets mix recommendations
- Pricing strategy shows market-based suggestions
- Absorption forecast shows velocity with time estimates
- Feedback loop connects agents to developers

**Estimated effort:** 3-4 weeks

### PARALLEL WORK (Can Start Simultaneously):
**Phase 1C: Singapore Market Integration**

**What to build:**
1. **PropertyGuru API Integration** (FEATURES.md lines 58)
   - OAuth authentication
   - Listing creation and management
   - Photo upload and management
   - Status sync (active/sold/leased)

2. **EdgeProp API Integration** (FEATURES.md lines 58)
   - Similar to PropertyGuru
   - Cross-platform listing management

3. **Marketing Automation** (FEATURES.md lines 61)
   - One-click publish to multiple platforms
   - Auto-watermarking (already exists)
   - Export tracking in audit system

**Files to create/modify:**
- `backend/app/services/integrations/propertyguru.py`
- `backend/app/services/integrations/edgeprop.py`
- `backend/app/api/v1/integrations/listings.py`
- `frontend/src/pages/MarketingIntegrationPage.tsx`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- One-click publish to PropertyGuru
- Listing syncs to EdgeProp
- All exports watermarked and tracked
- Status updates bidirectionally

**Estimated effort:** 4-6 weeks

**NOTE:** This requires external API access - may need API keys from user

## üö´ What NOT to Do Next

**DO NOT start these yet:**
- ‚ùå Phase 1D (Business Performance) - depends on 1B and 1C data
- ‚ùå Phase 2 (Developer Tools) - must finish Phase 1 and validate first
- ‚ùå Phase 3 (Architects) - way too early
- ‚ùå Phase 4 (Engineers) - way too early
- ‚ùå Phase 5 (Gov APIs) - can start later in parallel
- ‚ùå Phase 6 (Polish) - much later

**Why?**
- The delivery plan follows logical dependencies
- Each phase must be validated before moving on
- Jumping ahead creates integration debt

---

## üìö Key Documents You Must Reference

**Primary:**
- `FEATURES.md` - Complete product vision (YOUR SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- `docs/feature_delivery_plan_v2.md` - Complete roadmap (JUST CREATED)

**Supporting:**
- `docs/feature_delivery_plan.md` - Original plan (now superseded by v2)
- `CODING_RULES.md` - Code standards
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development workflow

**Always check:**
1. Read relevant section of `FEATURES.md` for requirements
2. Check `feature_delivery_plan_v2.md` for dependencies
3. Follow `CODING_RULES.md` for code standards
4. Run `make verify` before committing

---

## ü§ù When to Ask for Help

**Ask the human user when:**
- You need PropertyGuru/EdgeProp API credentials
- You're unsure about Singapore market data sources
- You need validation of advisory algorithm logic
- You encounter blockers that prevent progress
- You want to clarify feature requirements from FEATURES.md

**Don't ask about:**
- General implementation decisions (you can make those)
- Code structure (follow CODING_RULES.md)
- Testing approach (follow existing patterns)
- Documentation format (follow existing docs)

---

## üìä Progress Tracking

Update `docs/feature_delivery_plan_v2.md` as you complete features:

**When you finish a feature:**
1. Change status from ‚ùå NOT STARTED ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE
2. Update "Recent Progress Snapshot" section
3. Commit with message: "Complete [feature name] - Phase [X][Y]"

**Current Phase Status:**
```
Phase 1A: GPS Capture ‚úÖ COMPLETE
Phase 1B: Development Advisory ‚ùå NOT STARTED ‚Üê YOU ARE HERE
Phase 1C: Market Integration ‚ùå NOT STARTED
Phase 1D: Business Performance ‚ùå NOT STARTED
```

---

## üîÑ Validation Checkpoint

**After Phase 1B + 1C are complete:**
- Human will conduct agent validation sessions
- Feedback will be incorporated
- Then proceed to Phase 1D

**Do not skip validation!** It's critical for ensuring product-market fit.

---

## üöÄ Long-Term Vision

This is a **2.5 year project** to build the complete platform:
- Phase 1: Agent Foundation (70% done, 30% remaining)
- Phase 2: Developer Foundation (5% done, 95% remaining)
- Phase 3: Architect Workspace (0% done)
- Phase 4: Engineer Workspace (0% done)
- Phase 5: Platform Integration (10% done)
- Phase 6: Polish & Launch (0% done)

**You're doing great!** Phase 1A-1C was solid work. Now keep the momentum going with Phase 1B.
