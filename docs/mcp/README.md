# Master Control Prompt (MCP) Structure

The MCP rules are defined in the root directory to ensure high visibility for all agents.

## Core Documents

-   **[MCP.md](../../MCP.md)** - The **Constitution**. Contains Core Directives, Member Personas, and Agent Roster.
-   **[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)** - Claude-specific instructions for coding and refactoring.

## Usage

All agents must read `MCP.md` before starting any task. Claude agents should additionally read `CLAUDE.md` for detailed workflows.
