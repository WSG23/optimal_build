**Subject:** Quick walkthrough – new capture-to-pack workflow

Hi {{Agent Name}},

We’re piloting a faster way for advisors to go from GPS capture to a client-ready marketing pack, and we’d love your feedback.

**What we’ll cover (45 min):**
- Capture a Singapore site using the GPS logger
- Review the quick analysis + market intelligence snapshot
- Generate a marketing pack for investors/tenants
- Capture any gaps or tweaks you’d want before sharing with clients

**Proposed slots:**
- {{Option 1 – Date/Time SGT}}
- {{Option 2 – Date/Time SGT}}
- {{Option 3 – Date/Time SGT}}

Sessions are remote, recorded for note-taking, and we’ll keep the environment limited to seeded data. If another time works better, just reply with a couple of options.

Ahead of the call, you’ll receive:
- Staging login and direct link to the agent capture workspace
- Quickstart crib sheet (`docs/agents/marketing_pack_quickstart.md`)
- Known limitations so you’re not surprised mid-session

Thanks in advance — your feedback will help us decide the final polish before wider rollout.

Best,
{{Your Name}}
{{Role}} / Optimal Build
