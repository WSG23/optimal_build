## Walkthrough Script (Happy Path)

1. **Context (5 min)** – Quick recap of goals and new pack capability.
2. **Scenario Capture (10 min)** – Agent enters provided coordinates, reviews quick analysis cards. Prompts:
   - “What would you do next in your workflow?”
   - “Is the scenario language clear for your client?”
3. **Market Intelligence Panel (5 min)** – Review market snippet; ask whether metrics answer immediate questions.
4. **Marketing Pack Trigger (10 min)** – Agent generates preferred pack type; evaluate perceived usefulness of resulting document description/download flow.
5. **Open Exploration (5 min)** – Encourage deviations (change coordinates, deselect scenarios).
6. **Debrief (10 min)** – Capture highlights, blockers, and requests.
