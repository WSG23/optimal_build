# Third-Party Audit Guide

**Purpose:** This document provides standardized commands and procedures for third-party auditors to verify code quality, test coverage, and compliance.

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-02
**Current Coverage Baseline:** 60.23% (622 tests passing)

---

## Quick Reference

For a **complete audit**, run these two commands:

```bash
# 1. Backend test coverage with detailed report
SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key JOB_QUEUE_BACKEND=inline \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests \
    --cov=backend/app \
    --cov-report=term-missing \
    --cov-report=html

# 2. Code quality verification (formatting, linting, coding rules, tests)
make verify
```

Then review the generated HTML coverage report at `htmlcov/index.html`.

---

## Backend Test Coverage

### Recommended Command (Most Accurate)

```bash
SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key JOB_QUEUE_BACKEND=inline \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests \
    --cov=backend/app \
    --cov-report=term-missing \
    --cov-report=html
```

**Why this command:**
- ✅ Runs the complete test suite (all 622 tests)
- ✅ Includes all enabled integration tests
- ✅ Produces detailed line-by-line coverage with `--cov-report=term-missing`
- ✅ Generates browsable HTML report at `htmlcov/index.html`
- ✅ Uses `JOB_QUEUE_BACKEND=inline` for consistent async job execution
- ✅ This is the **official tracking command** used in coverage baselines

**Expected Results (as of 2025-11-02):**
- Overall coverage: **60.23%**
- Tests passing: **622**
- Coverage gap to 80% target: **19.77 percentage points**

### Alternative: Using Make Target

```bash
make test-cov
```

**⚠️ WARNING:** The `make test-cov` target has a **critical limitation** - it ignores several test files:
- `test_developer_site_acquisition.py` (enabled, contributes +1.86% coverage)
- `test_finance_asset_breakdown.py` (enabled, contributes +2.41% coverage)
- `test_openapi_generation.py`
- `test_rules.py`
- `test_condition_report_fallback.py`
- `test_pwp.py`
- `test_reference_sources.py`
- `test_aec_pipeline.py`

See [Makefile:272-281](../Makefile#L272-L281) for the list of ignored files.

**Result:** `make test-cov` will report **lower coverage** than the actual current state because it skips tests that have been enabled.

**Recommendation:** Use the direct pytest command above for accurate audit results.

## Code Quality Verification

### Comprehensive Quality Check

```bash
make verify
```

**What it checks:**
1. **Format checks** - Black (code formatting) and isort (import sorting)
2. **Linting** - Flake8 (Python), mypy (type checking), ESLint (frontend)
3. **Coding rules** - Validates compliance with [CODING_RULES.md](../../CODING_RULES.md)
4. **Delivery plan** - Validates ROADMAP.MD and WORK_QUEUE.MD structure
5. **Unit tests** - Runs fast unit tests

**Note:** `make verify` only runs unit tests (fast), not the full integration suite. For full coverage, use the pytest command above.

---

## Frontend Testing

### Run Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend && npm test
```

### Lint Frontend Code

```bash
cd frontend && npm run lint
```

---

## Pre-Commit Hooks Verification

The project uses pre-commit hooks for automatic code quality checks on every commit.

### Check Hook Status

```bash
make hooks
```

This runs all pre-commit hooks across the entire repository:
- **black** - Code formatting
- **ruff** - Import sorting + linting
- **prettier** - Frontend formatting
- **audit-migrations** - Database migration validation
- **pdf-smoke-test** - PDF generation smoke test

## Coverage Breakdown by Module

As of 2025-11-02 baseline (60.23% overall):

| Module | Coverage | Missing Lines | Priority |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------|
| **services/** | 50.2% | **3,866** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **api/** | 46.2% | **2,438** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| core/ | 73.1% | 501 | 🟡 Medium |
| utils/ | 71.4% | 231 | 🟡 Medium |
| models/ | 98.3% | 33 | ✅ Good |
| schemas/ | 94.3% | 70 | ✅ Good |

**Key Finding:** The `services/` and `api/` modules account for **6,304 missing lines** out of ~7,200 total uncovered lines.

See [coverage_opportunities.md](coverage_opportunities.md) for detailed improvement roadmap.

## Recent Coverage Improvements

### Session Progress (2025-11-02)

| Session | Baseline | Change | Work Done | Tests Added |
|---------|----------|--------|-----------|-------------|

| Session 1 | 55.96% | +0.58% | Enabled preview_jobs tests | +4 tests |
| Session 2 | 57.82% | +1.86% | Enabled developer site acquisition test | +1 test |
| Session 3 | **60.23%** | +2.41% | Enabled finance asset breakdown tests | +7 tests |

**Total improvement:** +4.85% coverage (+12 tests) by enabling existing skipped tests.

### Key File Improvements

1. **api/v1/finance.py**: 24.3% → **71.2%** (+46.9%, +456 lines)
   - Enabled 7 comprehensive tests in `test_finance_asset_breakdown.py`
   - Tests cover: asset mix breakdown, construction loans, sensitivity analysis, SSE streaming, authorization

2. **api/v1/developers.py**: 36.9% → **70.5%** (+33.7%, +307 lines)

## Output Interpretation

### Coverage Report Format

The terminal output shows:

```
backend/app/services/preview_jobs.py    85%    15-18, 45-47
backend/app/api/v1/finance.py          71%    125-130, 245-267, ...
TOTAL                                  60%
```

**How to read:**
- **Percentage** - Lines covered by tests
- **Missing lines** - Line numbers NOT covered (shown after percentage)
- **TOTAL** - Overall coverage across all files

### HTML Report Navigation

After running the pytest command with `--cov-report=html`, open `htmlcov/index.html` in a browser:

1. **Index page** - Shows all files sorted by coverage %
2. **Click any file** - View source with color-coded coverage:
   - 🟢 Green lines - Covered by tests
   - 🔴 Red lines - NOT covered by tests
   - ⚪ White lines - Not executable (comments, docstrings)
3. **Sort columns** - Click headers to sort by name, coverage %, missing lines

---

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions / CI Pipeline

The project uses pre-commit hooks that run automatically on every commit. To simulate CI checks locally:

```bash
# Run all pre-commit hooks
make hooks

# Run full verification suite
make verify

# Run coverage measurement
SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key JOB_QUEUE_BACKEND=inline \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests \
    --cov=backend/app --cov-report=term
```

## Common Audit Questions

### Q: What is the current test coverage?
**A:** 60.23% as of 2025-11-02 (622 tests passing). See [PRE_PHASE_2D_INFRASTRUCTURE_AUDIT.MD](../../PRE_PHASE_2D_INFRASTRUCTURE_AUDIT.MD) for baseline tracking.

### Q: What is the coverage target?
**A:** 80% backend coverage (Rule 10.1 in [CODING_RULES.md](../../CODING_RULES.md)).

### Q: How is coverage measured?
**A:** Using pytest-cov with the command documented in this guide. Results are tracked in the audit log after each improvement.

- [PRE_PHASE_2D_INFRASTRUCTURE_AUDIT.MD](../../PRE_PHASE_2D_INFRASTRUCTURE_AUDIT.MD) - Session log with detailed history
- [coverage_opportunities.md](coverage_opportunities.md) - Coverage history log table

### Q: What test framework is used?
**A:**
- Backend: pytest + pytest-asyncio + pytest-cov
- Frontend: Vitest (npm test)

### Q: How long do tests take to run?
**A:**
- Full backend suite: ~2-3 minutes (622 tests)
- Unit tests only: ~30-60 seconds
- Frontend tests: ~10-30 seconds
