# City-specific notes:
# - Auckland: Primary market with most liquidity, data above primarily reflects Auckland
# - Wellington: Limited data available, use Auckland assumptions as proxy
# - Christchurch: Limited data available, use Auckland assumptions as proxy with potential 10-15% rent discount
#
# TODO for future updates:
# - Gather Wellington and Christchurch specific rent/vacancy data
# - Validate residential rent assumptions with actual market data
# - Update quarterly as new CBRE/Colliers reports are released
